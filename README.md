AutoGenXml was written for a fairly specific task, which might be use to others (or ofcourse you can fork/copy it in anyway you want to match your requirements). I thought I'd place it on github in case anyone had a use for such a tool.

The source is released under the MIT license.

What does it do?

Whilst editing XSD which define the XML one of my applications needs to store data in, I found myself in need of a quick means to turn the Xml schema into a C# class and then see what the resultant Xml would look like.

So I'd edit the XSD file, run xsd.exe to create a C# class then want to view the resultant Xml from serializing this class.

AutoGenXml takes as arguments, the class file (generated by xsd.exe or hand crafted with appropriate Xml serialization attributes) and it also requires the name of the type in the class file that we want to run against/generate Xml from.

For example

AutoGenXml -C c:\dev\person.cs -T Person

This results in an Xml file named &lt;Type&gt;.xml, hence in the example above that would be Person.xml.
